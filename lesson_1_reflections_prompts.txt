How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

By showing me de differences between files

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

Helps you not having to write everything again

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Less work, but ultimately saving time

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Its easier to keep up the changes and sometimes when you add or remove a
    element, you are supposed to change it in all the files you've been working

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Haven't seen it yet

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    If something goes wrong, you only have to come back to the prior file

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Working on music production and programming
